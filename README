This is a simple application to watch the latest files of some selected directories.

You can use this, for example, if you have to wait for some processing to generate / remove files on directories. Then instead of manually "polling" the directories (by refreshing explorer windows or issuing ls commands every few seconds) just open dir_monitor and watch as the files come and go.

The directories to be watched are configured in the dir_monitor.conf file, located in the current dir.
Format:

=========================================================
Dir Description 1 = /path/to/directory
Another Monitored Dir = /path/to/other/place/of/interest

On Windows:
Dir Description = C:\path\to\directory\in\windows
=========================================================
